The Azure Naming Tool is designed for easy updates, regardless of the hosting scenario. The tool will receive regular updates, often requiring refreshing the local version with updated functionality. All configurations files are stored in the **/settings** folder. This folder can be backed up/restored manually, or via the Configuration Page to ensure all settings are retained during updating. This page details the updating process.
