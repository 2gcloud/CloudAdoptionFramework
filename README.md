# Cloud Adoption Framework - Secure Accelerator

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) for Azure is proven guidance that's designed to help create and implement the business and technology strategies necessary for organizations to succeed in the cloud. It provides best practices, documentation, and tools that cloud architects, IT professionals, and business decision makers need to successfully achieve short-term and long-term objectives.

CAF consists of multiple methodologies, providing the right guidance at the right time in an organization's journey. The **Secure** methodology provides security guidance by providing clarity for the processes, best practices, models, and experiences. This guidance is based on the lessons learned and real world experiences of real customers, Microsoft's security journey, and work with organizations like NIST, The Open Group, and the Center for Internet Security (CIS).

## Secure Accelerator

This repo contains artifacts to accompany the CAF Secure Accelerator workshop. As a partner, you can use the content included in here, along with the partner delivery guide, to work with your customers across the various security disciplines.

These artifacts, when deployed into a greenfield environment will illustrate a solid foundation for the concepts:

* Azure AD _emergency access_ accounts
* Azure AD conditional access policies
* Azure Subscription Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  * Including JIT access
* Azure Policy
* Azure Security Center
  * Azure Defender
  * Azure Security Benchmark
  * Azure CIS Regulatory reporting

| :warning: Greenfield Deployment Only |
|:------------------------------|
| These artifacts are designed for illustrative purposes in a **greenfield environment**. They are NOT suitable to be executed, without modification, against pre-existing Azure AD tenants or Azure Subscriptions. Doing so could result in **critical failure/misconfiguration** on the existing subscriptions and/or tenant due to pre-existing configuration not accounted for by the scripts. |
